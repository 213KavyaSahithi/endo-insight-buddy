## ENDO-INSIGHT-BUDDY

Endo Insight Buddy is a privacy-first AI-powered web application designed to help users understand their potential risk for endometriosis through an interactive and educational assessment.
It provides personalized risk insights, visual explanations, and evidence-based recommendations, while ensuring 100% data privacy — your data never leaves your browser.

## How it Works?

**1️⃣ Data Collection:**
You provide basic health details such as:
- Age
- Symptom severity (pain, fatigue, irregular cycles, etc.)
- Medical and family history
- Optional biomarker data (CA-125, CRP levels)

**2️⃣ Risk Analysis:**

Our AI model evaluates your input based on clinical research data and known risk factors associated with endometriosis.

**3️⃣ Visual Results:**
You’ll receive:
- A risk percentage (low, moderate, or high)
- Visual insights highlighting key contributing factors
- Personalized recommendations for next steps and self-care

## Scientific Background

Endometriosis affects roughly 1 in 10 women of reproductive age and often takes years to diagnose due to non-specific symptoms.

This AI model considers:

- Symptom severity: dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia
- Family history of endometriosis
- Menstrual cycle characteristics (age of menarche, duration, regularity)
- Biomarker levels (CA-125, CRP — optional inputs)
- Associated conditions (e.g., PCOS, infertility)
- Lifestyle and mental health factors
